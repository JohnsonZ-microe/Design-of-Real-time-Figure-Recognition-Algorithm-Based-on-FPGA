# Design-of-Real-time-Figure-Recognition-Algorithm-Based-on-FPGA
As the mechine learning techniques being widely implemented in social and industrial field, it gives higher request to the accuracy of recognition of objectsâ€™feature. Based on the high-speed performance of FPGA platform, the algorithm proposed in this paper aims to extract the imformation of the gesture, mainly the skin color and contours. Using ellipse model color space division and gaussian function weighting structure, the algorithm can perfectly realize the combination of skin color and contours, and filter the irrelevant imformation effectively
